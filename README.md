* [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iKBgpcbZ87xw8Kw9oIA6z6mKHw8Q6pfWGXVQtlmzVsg/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Report](https://www.overleaf.com/9268358524drbshrvphctj#c26109)

Basic outline:

front end/UI:
* basically just an endless loop that thte user can use to interface with the system
* assumg users know keys
* how to display information

backend
* Manage users login/logout
* Interact with database
* Offer calls that the frontend can use to access data
* Maybe combine with databse portion

Database:
* Store data
* encrypted_mimic.db is an encrypted version of mimic4.db
* Run main.py with encrypted_mimic.db, but you can use mimic4.db for reference to access the data

MIMIC FILES:
* The data is stord in mimic4.db
* This is only one table in the whole database
* I can send you the other data if you want
* We will just be working with the patient table for this project due to scope
