* assumg users know keys
* how to display information

backend
* Manage users login/logout
* Interact with database
* Offer calls that the frontend can use to access data
* Maybe combine with databse portion

Database:
* Store data
* Maybe combine with backend

MIMIC FILES:
* The data is stord in mimic4.db
* This is only one table in the whole database
* I can send you the other data if you want
* We will just be working with the patient table for this project due to scope
