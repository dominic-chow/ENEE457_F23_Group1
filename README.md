Basic outline:

front end/UI:
* handles commands from the user
* login, view, edit

Backend
* Interact with database
* Offer calls that the frontend can use to access data
* encrypt/decrypt data and filters

Database:
* Store data
* encrypted_mimic.db is an encrypted version of mimic4.db
* Run main.py with encrypted_mimic.db, but you can use mimic4.db for reference to access the data
